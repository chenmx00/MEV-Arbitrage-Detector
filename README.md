# MEV Arbitrage Detector

# Usage

```shell
pip install moralis 
./mev_arb_detector.py
```

## Design Overview
1. Download all the historical transactions' receipts in a local directory. So we don't have to constantly calling the APIs during development and testing.
2. For each block, read through all the corresponding transaction receipts(with focus on transfer and swap events), determine if there is arbitrage in each transaction. If there is, record the token contract address and the arbitraged amount, save it for later.
3. Using Moralis API, we are able to fetch the token price at a given block time on a given chain.
4. We calculate the total revenue of a tx as: *total revenue of a tx* =  sum(arb_token1_price * arb_token2_amonut). 
5. The total cost of a tx can be computed as total cost of a tx = gas_used * gas_price * bnb_price(In the block where the tx is at).
6. The total profit of a tx = total revenue of a tx - total cost of a tx.

## Implemenation Details and workflow

1. `./TxReceiptGenerator.py`  first fetches a list of `tx_hash` in each block by calling `eth_getBlockByNumber` method in `https://docs-demo.bsc.quiknode.pro/`
2. Given a list of `tx_hash` for each block, we then call ` eth_getTransactionReceipt` to get `tx_recipt` for each `tx_hash` . In additon, we are also calling `eth_getTransactionByHash` to get the `value` field and `gasPrice` field. we then dump these data into a json file under `/tx_recipts` for our main parser to read. Note that here we have to limit our request to the API endpoint around 5 times/s due to quiknode's rate limiter.
3. Running the program by `./mev_arb_detector.py` .
   1.  In `dispatch_block(start_block, end_block)`, for each block, it loads the `tx_receipts.json` file first to parse the relevant `tx_receipts` info, then we are calling `process_tx(tx_hash, tid, receipt)` for each transaction.
   2. In `process_tx(tx_hash, tid, receipt)`, we loop through the event logs for each transaction and aiming for `transfer` and `swap` based on `topics[0]` for each log.
   3. We maintain a `balances` dict {address => {token_address: token_amount}}. for each `transfer` event encountered, we update this `balances` dict. and we also build a graph incrementally based on `transfer`. For each `swap` event we encountered, we add the address for the `swap` itself into a set. In addition, we also add the swapped addresses for each swap into a set. 
   4. After processing all the event logs, if there's a positive balance for any token in `balances`, there might be an abitrage for this transaction. But we still need to go throuh a series of checks to filter it.
   5. If a transaction is an arbitrage transaction, we keep track of `gas_used` and `gas_price` in this transaction and returns ` [tid, tx_hash, arb_tokens, gas_used, gas_price]`.
   6. In order to determine the usd_price for each arbitraged token, we need to use an external API, I chose moralis because it gives the usd_price for any ERC20 token on BSC at any given block. In order to minimize the amount of calls the program makes to query the API, we keep track of the arbitrage information for each transaction till the end of processing every block. Thus, we only need to call the API once at the end of processing each block(the price wouldn't change within a block). Finally, In `process_pnl(arb_res_block, block)` we fetch the usd_price for each token from the returned dictionary and compute the revenue, cost and profit for each arbitrage transaction.

## Testing, Proof of Correctness and Some Analysis

In order to test correctness for the occurences of arbitrage transactions. I used EigenPhi as a reference, Under `/tests`, for each block I manually created a `*_ref` file that contains the referenced arbitrage transaction id in each block. When running  `./mev_arb_detector.py` , it writes `_res` file which contains abitrage transaction id  into `/tests` directory. You can run `./CheckResult.sh` to compare the differneces between the result my program produced and the result I gathered from EigenPhi.

Here I listed all 3 differences between the results my program produced and the results listed on EigenPhi web UI.  I investigated each of these differences. I think there could be bugs in the EigenPhi website that identifying arbitrage trades or I am missing something. Please share your thoughts I'm curious :)

- Differences:

  - Block 40784970

    - [Tx118](https://eigenphi.io/mev/eigentx/0x89c0f2c0184541e9cba8a8ec7811e7caa1f56e7a25e3b1cc411f8003762ebf3c): EigenTx didn't mark this one as arbitrage but I think it should be. contract address `0x7bba2A9A00a8b5D3BE3f86F5c6140Bf6E5F79A1` didn't receive funding from EOA before the transaction events. It completes a series of swapping(pancakeV2 <=> pancakeV2 <=> pancakeV3) and ended up with +0.021489 WBNB on its balance. At the end, it transfered +0.021489 WBNB into to an EOA leaf node address (`0xC0CA1BDE7339a71709878acb4477B1D072EACF00`). This tx should be an arbitrage tx with +0.021489 WBNB in my opinion.
    - [Tx128](https://eigenphi.io/mev/eigentx/0x1d71c57641c6902bbf2cc6b5e890f7c4b1d681926d26dddeee64654cd4190e78) Same as above.

  - Block 40784971

    - [Tx96](https://eigenphi.io/mev/eigentx/0x424b57560fe4ae639f9e21c293a21af72443a39cb08a618e7816ba08485bbb41): EigenTx didn't mark this one as arbitrage but I think it should be. This is a interesting one where the arbitraged account is not tx_to contract address in the transaction. Instead it's an EOA. We can clearly see `0xDc5497014D5BBE0f0c8b54F049f1682DC9beed46` ended up with +0.007080 USDT in its balance after the swapping. However, what confuses me is where does the address `0xDc5497014D5BBE0f0c8b54F049f1682DC9beed46` come from? Because this addres is neither `From` nor `To` of the transaction. My guess is `0xDc5497014D5BBE0f0c8b54F049f1682DC9beed46` might be hardcoded in the [contract](0x48e29Cc270a9421CA95F373786F3b15B812370f6) where this tx is interacting with. So the workflow of this tx might be the [sending party](0xa3EB1AcC8CE4Cd8fa5BAB8787570d944b82387FD) invoked `0x22a3d2bd` method on the [contract](0x48e29Cc270a9421CA95F373786F3b15B812370f6). But instead of the contract starts arbitrage process on its own, it called another hardcoded address(0xDc5497014D5BBE0f0c8b54F049f1682DC9beed46) and started the arbitrage loop. I could be completely wrong here but that's my hypothesis.

      

  Now, Let's check the correctness of revenue and profit for each arbitrage transaction. Because the fiat price source I'm using comes from moralis API so there might be small difference between the fiat price source EigenPhi is using, so I'm checking the correctness by manually comparing.

## Interesting findings 

- An event log without topic0. I filtered out such event https://bscscan.com/tx/0x3fca216d1c39fabb5f248df4eef7a963adebbf6e67dca12413ed9853398f5e06#eventlog
- Sometimes tokens get burnt and sent into an 0x00 address, I need to filter them out when computing final arbitrage results.
